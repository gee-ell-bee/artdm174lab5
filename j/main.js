/**
 * main.js
 * The init script for this HTML5 Video Application
 * This app is used as a demo for creating a video application utilizing the video API
 * built into HTML5. It is inspired by Bruce Lawson's example hack for creating video captions.
 * I added the ability to associate custom callbacks with moments in time of the video.
 *
 * 
 * @NOTE: Mozilla released Popcorn and Butter for doing the same thing right after I got this working.
 * @UPDATE: Popcorn and Butter are dead. This is now useful again. I've updated it to be vanilla JS 
 * with no dependencies. by Troy Bennett 7-2010 (updated 12-2021)
