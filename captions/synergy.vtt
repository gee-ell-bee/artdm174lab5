Hi, my name's Dr Archimedes Einstein and 

1
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.200
I'm a Doctor of Science at the University of Science

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.500
in a very famous town that you're too stupid to have heard of.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.500
Anyway, today we're going to talk about "synergies".

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.500
A lot of people are worried about synergies 

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.000
but I can tell you that statistics show

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.000
there is no danger of increased cancer risk from synergies.

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
However, it's better to be safe than sorry.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm going to demonstrate how you how we can leverage a synergy.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500
First of all, I've got this banana

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.000
This banana represents "Web 2.0" and look,

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I've written on it some "user-generated content"

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
just to prove the point [You Suck, WTF, LOL]

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I take my "Web 2.0" and I put it in an envelope

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
marked "paradigm shift".

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
OK. Very important, I put the envelope down and

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.000
With a bit of "blue sky thinking"

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.000
I "push the envelope"

18
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Then, I take my leverage mallet, and

19
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.000
URGH!

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
RGRRRRRARGRGGH!!

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
EURGGGARRRRGGGRRGARGG!! AHAARRAGGHGRRAGAHAARGH!!!!

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.500
...and there we can see a synergy, leveraged.
