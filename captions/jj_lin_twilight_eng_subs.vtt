WEBVTT JJ Lin - Twilight; English Subtitles

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.262
[instrumental]

2
00:00:24.263 --> 00:00:30.400
Forgive me for this song,

3
00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:33.855
Not written to anyone in particular.

4
00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:40.201
I have a feeling the night sky
out of this window

5
00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:43.471
is one I've seen before

6
00:00:43.472 --> 00:00:46.771
But when I look back, suddenly
I don't recognize a thing

7
00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:53.829
I'm searching through my memories
over and over / Of people,

8
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.091
And those they care about

9
00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:00.871
Of places,

10
00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:05.257
And the ones I've moved beyond

11
00:01:05.457 --> 00:01:08.586
Please, wait a minute

12
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.171
Hard work melted
<i>[my]</i> dreams down to water

13
00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:16.486
Love's at my back
pushing me to keep going

14
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.700
But only when I lift
my head up do I realize,

15
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:22.900
I might have forgotten
somebody along the way

16
00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:26.114
So tired I can't sleep all night

17
00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:29.848
Everywhere you look you see
the beauty of the night sky

18
00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:34.886
There must be someone; hiding away,
escaping, dodging, concealing herself,

19
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:47.389
Who is she? Who is she

20
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.686
Ooh

21
00:01:49.687 --> 00:01:53.190
Forgive me for this song

22
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.386
Not written to anyone in particular

23
00:01:56.387 --> 00:02:02.471
I have a feeling the night sky
out of this window

24
00:02:02.657 --> 00:02:09.929
is one I've seen before, but
I look back and suddenly
I don't recognize a thing

25
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:16.743
I'm searching through my memories
over and over / Of people,

26
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:21.781
And those they care about

27
00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:29.575
Of places, and the people
I've moved beyond

28
00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:36.313
Hard work melted <i>[my]</i> dreams
down to water, but love's at
my back pushing me to keep going

29
00:02:36.314 --> 00:02:40.057
Only when I lift my head up do I realize,

30
00:02:40.058 --> 00:02:42.781
I might have forgotten
somebody along the way

31
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:49.342
So tired I can't sleep all night,
everywhere you look you see
the beauty of the night sky

32
00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:54.347
There must be someone; hiding away,
escaping, dodging, concealing herself,

33
00:02:54.547 --> 00:03:04.547
Who is she, who is she?

34
00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:07.786
Ohh

35
00:03:08.514 --> 00:03:14.986
Maybe only when I truly face myself
can I release my inhibitions,

36
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.329
And uncover what at first
I was too afraid to face

37
00:03:23.857 --> 00:03:30.986
Hard work melted <i>[my]</i> dreams
down to water, but love's at
my back pushing me to keep going

38
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.229
Only when I lift my head up
do I realize, I might have
forgotten somebody along the way

39
00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:44.000
So tired I can't sleep all night,
everywhere you look you see
the beauty of the night sky

40
00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:48.629
She must be there; hiding away,
escaping, dodging, concealing herself,

41
00:03:48.630 --> 00:04:03.414
Who is she? Who is she?

42
00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:08.329
[piano instrumental]

43
00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:12.205
Who is she?

44
00:04:12.206 --> 00:04:22.206
[instrumental]
