					<h2>Twilight by J.J. Lin</h2>
					<p>Forgive me for this song, not written to anyone in particular.<br>
						I have a feeling the night sky out of this window<br>
						is one I've seen before. But when I look back, suddenly I don't recognize a thing.<br>
						I'm searching through my memories over and over; of people, and those they care about<br>
						Of places, and the ones I've moved beyond; Please, wait a minute</p>

					<p>Hard work melted [my] dreams down to water. Love's at my back pushing me to keep going<br>
						But only when I lift my head up do I realize, I might have forgotten somebody along the way.<br>
						So tired I can't sleep all night, everywhere you look you see the beauty of the night sky<br>
						There must be someone; hiding away, escaping, dodging, concealing herself,<br>
						Who is she?<br>
						Who is she</p>

					<p>Ooh</p>

					<p>Ohh</p>

					<p>Maybe only when I truly face myself can I release my inhibitions,<br>
						And uncover what at first I was too afraid to face</p>
